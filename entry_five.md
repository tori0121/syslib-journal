This week, we are learning about LAMP servers and, specifically, we are installing Apache. 
# What is a LAMP Server?
It stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, which are the four key components that make up this server setup. I want to break this down further so that I can keep track of how these parts interconnect. 

1. Linux -> Open source OS that serves as the foundation of the server.
2. Apache -> A very popular web server that supports a wide range of configurations. It also has a strong community support. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving web pages to users. When I type a website address into my browser, Apache handles the request, processes it, and sends back the web page.
3. MySQL -> To be discussed
4. PHP -> To be discussed

# Installing & Setting Up Apache:
I installed Apache using w3m. To do this, I installed w3m using the sudo apt install command, which gave me no issues. Before installing apache, I did have to reset my VM because I was getting a 'lock' error that I could not bypass. While I did find some online forums that broke down how to get past this, I was still struggling and so re-established my VM following along with the notes from https://cseanburns.github.io/systems-librarianship/2a-using-gcloud-virtual-machines.html 

It does throw me off a bit that the link to my website is through the VM external link, which I'm posting here as well: http://34.56.87.225/
I think I was expecting it to pop up in the terminal alongside my other files for some reason? Regardless, installing Apache was straightforward and using the html was fun!

# HTML Notes
HTML acts as the skeleton of a webpage, specifying where text, images, links, and other media should be placed on a page. I'm still getting used to links and media specificially with HTML, but the rest is easy to emulate and practice. 
I like how customizable HTML is and can see it being a useful tool for curating an online catalog or other digital  organizational model.
