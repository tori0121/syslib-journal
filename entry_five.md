This week, we are learning about LAMP servers and, specifically, we are installing Apache. 
# What is a LAMP Server?
It stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, which are the four key components that make up this server setup. I want to break this down further so that I can keep track of how these parts interconnect. 

1. Linux -> Open source OS that serves as the foundation of the server.
2. Apache -> A very popular web server that supports a wide range of configurations. It also has a strong community support.

3. MySQL -> To be discussed
4. PHP -> To be discussed
