<p>I am feeling a little bit lost. I feel like I am unable to do most of the functions without following the lectures or going over the readings multiple times.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the grep reading this week and do see how it would be useful, but also struggle with applying that outside of this class and I'm not sure how to reconcile that. For example, it was very helpful in condensing a lot of information into a format that was easy to sift through, but I also struggled with seeing how to apply it to other areas, likely because it all still confuses me a bit.</p>
<p>The <i>imposter syndrome</i> is hitting hard in this class. I feel capable, but then I feel like I'm not doing as well as I should be or could be?</p>

>Things I enjoy about this class:
>
>>This information is so new! It's exciting doing things I've never done before.
>>This information is relevant in a world that needs people who understands computers and systems and how to work with them.
>>The class is easy to get into and the layout is user friendly, helping me understand things as we go along.

It's a great class and I see the merit of it, but.... 

>Things I struggle with:
>
>>Feeling lost almost every week but not exactly sure why I feel lost?
>>Not fully understanding how to document my notes, likely because of the reason above. 

I am trying to feel more confident and try new things, but it's not easy.
