# PHP - What is it?

## 1. Purpose:
PHP is a scripting language that is used for backend web developemn. It processes and generates HTML, manages databases (like MySQL), and performs actions on the server before sending results to the browser.
This is different than JavaScript (which I have slightly more familiarity with) which is also used for web-development and is the main language for scripting. 

## 2. How it works and runs: 
PHP is server-side processing language that works well with HTML. I looked into when PHP is typically used and found that PHP typically handles things like processing form submissions, querying a database, or sending emails. It's not used for immediate interaction on the client side. It directly interacts with databases. It's often used to query databases, fetch data, and update records in the database.
