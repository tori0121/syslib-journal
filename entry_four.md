*This entry is a little late because I ended up getting really sick before I could compile my notes for the week!*

This past week, we learned about searching with grep. The usefulness of grep is obvious -- being able to search line by line is useful for a variety of reasons. I used it this week to condense and manage the search string "community archives" in InfoKat. Being able to download the BibTeX and use the VM to investigate the files, narrow them down based on type or author,  was really interestingand I can see how this would be incoprated into managing said resources. While reading through each step felt like a lot, the work itself wasn't strenuous. 

Something that I have noticed about myself is the modules that have more steps tend to make me feel anxious when I first look over them, but reminding myself that it's a process usually helps. 

This week has just been off for me since I've gotten sick, and I look forward to practicing more of the commands outside of class examples. 

Speaking of, I really enjoyed playing around with the yaz-client commands to search catalogs. I found JSON (converted records using the jq command) to be easier to read and navigate, but I wonder if that's because I've seen/briefly manipulated JSON files before for *Stardew Valley*  modding purposes.

The games were probably the most fun part of the week. I immediately put backgammon on my personal terminal and shared with my husband how to do so as well! Being able to walk it through with him and speaking it aloud was helpful for learning the materials. I think something I want to try is talking about what I'm learning with him or my mom or just anybody really, and typing out what I'm saying here. I think it would be a good reflective moment for me.
