# Tori's Ramblings

## This repo is a testament to all that I have learned this semester! Throughout this course, I have gained valuable insight into systems librarianship and have learned some basic skills that go into creating the vital systems librarians use everyday.

### This semester I have learned:
1. How to document information on GitHub through a VM.
2. CLI and markdown basics.
3. How to use 'grep', how to download games, and perform catalog searches.
4. How to install and use a LAMP server. 
5. How to create, update, and utilize a bare-bones OPAC

I am eager to see how the rest of the semester goes and look forward to finishing the year strong ♡︎
