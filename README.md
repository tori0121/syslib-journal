#**Tori's Ramblings**
##This personal repository will document my personal notes, resources, and snippets for the Spring 2025 Systems Librarianship class.
---
> #### What I've learned so far:
>
> - Systems librarianship encompasses a multi-faceted role in libraries and is no longer an isolated position.
> - Ubuntu comes from the philosophy of *ubuntu* which means "humanity to others" which is pretty interesting considering how far-reaching and interconnected this os is. 
> - Learning the CLI is intimidating but not impossible!
> - I am capable of hard things â™¡ which is to say I can do things I've never tried/done before!

As I learn more and become more comfortable with the commands and actions, I hope to see this file expand and change too.
