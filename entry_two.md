This week we are practicing more with the CLI.
I am getting slightly more comfortable, but it's still an ongoing process.

I am working on HTML basics too, such as:<ul>
  <li><strong>bold text</strong></li>
  <li><em>italicized text</li>
  <li><u>underline text</u></li>
</ul> 

<p>I feel like I am doing most of this wrong, but it's fun to feel like the embodiment of<br>  <em><strong>hacker voice: I'm in.</em></strong></p>
