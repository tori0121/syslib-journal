This week we are practicing more with the CLI.
I am getting slightly more comfortable, but it's still an ongoing process.

I am working on HTML basics too, such as:<ul>
  <li><strong>bold text</strong></li>
  <li><em>italicized text</em></li>
  <li><u>underline text</u></li>
</ul> 

<p>I feel like I am doing most of this wrong, but it's fun to feel like the embodiment of <em><strong>hacker voice: I'm in.</em></strong></p> 

I found a website that has been helpful in understanding markdown. It serves as a basic guide and has useful information. It's easy to follow along and it's helped me gain some confidence in playing around. 

*Edit 02/11/25 -- I realized I didn't format this correctly and was able to use the guide and what we talked about in class to figure it out. Just have to remember how crucial those little details are!
